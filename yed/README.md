## Overview

yEd is a diagram editing application, which has nice layout algorithms and can import various data formats. yWorks seems
to have other software that's more powerful and probably handles triple data better, but much of their offerings are
paid (free trials are available, but only last for 60 days).

## Instructions

Download and install yEd from https://www.yworks.com/products/yed/download#download . Installation is available for
Windows, Mac, and Linux.
